# Code for Machine Learning for Hackers in julia

## About
Code from [Machine Learning for Hackers](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/ML_for_Hackers) book, inspired in [ML_for_Hackers](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/ML_for_Hackers), but it's write in Julia instead R. I'm using [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) because it's the very best way to interact and see the code.

## Geting started

The code in this book relies on several Julia libraries.

To make sure you have all of the requite libraries run the package_installer.jl script. In your console type the following:

> julia package_installer

## Contribuiting
If you do not put fire, submit your code, and everything will be fine.
